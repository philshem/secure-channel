### Project title
(80 max characters)

Secure CHannel: Fight Misinformation. Strengthen Public Participation.

### Describe your project in 2-3 sentences.
(250 max characters)

The public sector uses social media to share information. Misinformation creates confusion and decreases public participation. We will build a decentralized, transparent and open-sourced social-media certification platform to prevent misinformation.

### Which societal challenge does your project address?
(600 max characters)

Here‚Äôs a scenario: A small Swiss town uses Twitter - but barely. They are unaware that the team-password has been leaked in a data breach. The account is compromised. Fraudulent tweets, even as a joke, are retweeted by a blogger with many followers. Despite being easily disproved, research shows that (1) many people will never follow-up, and (2) misinformation causes us to doubt any political stance, thus becoming "unpolitical". Without an open repository of content with secure authentication and transparent authorization, we will continue to struggle with political disengagement.

### Who in the Swiss population do you want to be using your digital solution? (Target group)
(600 max characters)

The initial users are in the public sector who inform the public through social media. We don‚Äôt replace existing social media channels, but rather provide a management platform, i.e Hootsuite, with enhanced security that ensures that the content is certified. We will provide web-links to certified posts at Twitter and Facebook. Our platform will display badges such as IP-whitelisting and ‚Äú2-human authorization‚Äù. Because our users are the content providers, we are less susceptible to the ‚Äúnetwork effect‚Äù, meaning we don‚Äôt need millions of installs to reach millions of people.

### How will your digital solution increase or deepen democratic participation? (Theory of change)
(600 max characters)

Challenges: Government agencies use social media, and are susceptible to account suspension, hacking or spoofing. Public participation will continue to decrease due to confusion and misinformation.

Approach: Certify social media content. Open-sourced for security audits. Enhanced authentication, similar to online banking. Publicly viewable "badges" to explain account security.

Outcomes: The public (and media) can trust the authenticity. Transparent web-links to and from social media platforms. Mitigate risk of financial and reputational damage. Democratic participation is strengthened.

Giving information to the population

### How do you build on existing analog or digital solutions in Switzerland or abroad?
(600 max characters)

For the back-end, we will consider existing blockchain frameworks such as Swiss-based foundation Ethereum.org. We‚Äôll create a developer-friendly API that allows for modular add-ons (e.g. mobile apps). For the front-end, we will choose an open-source, progressive webapp framework. In addition to the web-app, we will provide open-access RSS feeds of all public content. Existing social media platforms provide user APIs which we will use for posting content to their sites. We will use Swiss-based cloud services, such as from Infomaniak.

### How will you develop your tool on the technical level? Please also comment on the division of tasks within the team.
(800 max characters)

Our delivery is a team-shared social media management tool (i.e. Hootsuite). We do *not* replace existing social media platforms, but instead supplement missing security features and certify content as authenticated and authorized.

### Which experiences prepare you for this project? If you have ever worked on open source projects, please provide links to max. 3 projects (with link)

### Does your team miss any skills that would improve your project or would contribute to making it more successful?
(250 max characters)

Because our users are few and are already publicly identifiable, we expect to contact them directly to pitch our service. But it's often the case that tech startups underestimate the need for marketing.

### If we find a person that has the required skills, would you open to collaborating with that person? (of course, you will still have the chance to say no).
(yes/no)

yes

### Have you already worked on your idea?
(yes/no)

no

### Please outline the 4 most important milestones that you and your team plan to implement during the funding period. You can refer to supplementary documentation that you can upload in the attachment section.
(500 max characters)

ONE (month 1): User journey mapping. MVP feature freeze. Role-based access control and security review. Answers to: (a) which OSS license, (b) what authentication, (c) what authorization features, (d) go or no-go with blockchain? Naming and branding.

TWO (months 2-3): Alpha-version back-end API and testing. Front-end wireframes and UX/UI concept.

THREE (months 4-5): Completion of front-end. Internal QA.

FOUR (month 6): Release the platform for at least 10 UAT beta-users.

### Have you already thought about how you or others could continue improving your project after the end of the funding period? (Project sustainability)
(600 max characters)

We plan to start a non-profit association (Verein) for (1) transparent salaries, and (2) accepting payment for the service from our users, who will be association members (membership fees will cover hosting and other costs). We expect that this project can sustain itself after funding for several reasons. As an open source project, any person or group can contribute to improving the tool, or even fork the code and run their own instance. For those who don't want to join the association, we can also offer a self-hosting solution and then offer paid support or custom feature development.

### Have you already identified or even talked to your future users (your target group)?
(600 max characters)

We have conducted a market research survey that focused on team-access to social media from the public sector. Most respondents had little confidence in BOTH the security offered by the platforms AND by the security measures taken by their organization. A summary of results is available as supplementary information.

Additionally, we have informally chatted with several users of shared team-accounts to understand the problems of sharing access to team social media accounts, as well as to formalize the need for a secure channel that restores public trust and engagement. The need is there.

### What are your considerations regarding data privacy and data security? Which other risks have you considered? You might want to check OWASP's list of top ten privacy risks (see FAQ)

The added-value of our service is the enhanced authentication and authorization for posting to existing social media channels. For that reason, as part of Milestone 1, we will conduct a full security review to ensure our platform is conforming to the OWASP recommendations. We will also request an external security audit between the conceptualization and implementation phases.

Being open source, we invite and expect users and researchers to review and audit the source code.

### Here you can share any information that we should be aware of. You can refer to supplementary documentation that you can upload in the attachment section.
